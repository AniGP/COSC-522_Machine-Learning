### Assignment 1: Using an Existing Dataset

- Find the Assignment1.ipynb in Assignments/AutismDetection folder in our shared Dropbox folder. The notebook uses a dataset collected by some researchers aiming to identify people with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Research has indicated that an autistic individual often shows atypical fixation and gaze patterns. 

- In this project, the researchers have demonstrated that by monitoring a userâ€™s gaze as they watch videos, they can identify individuals with autism spectrum disorder. They recruited 35 autistic and 25 non-autistic individuals, and captured their gaze using an off-the-shelf eye tracker connected to a laptop.

- The notebook already has code to read the recorded data and load gaze points for each participant for each video. There are two videos in the notebook right now. The goal of the assignment is to use the loaded data to extract meaningful features, normalize your data, ensure there is no class imbalance, try out different machine learning algorithms, and assess the effect on performance as you change some parameters of the algorithms.

- The notebook has specific questions and grading strategy in more detail.
